+ "reboot" command added to the runner
+ Using numbers 1 â†’ 4 you can open the different dropdowns in the widgets page

+ Added max USB version to "Specs" application and thus new "usb version" placeholder

* The widgets page updates every minute and now has a fade transition when anything happens
* The error background colour (open "Utilities" to see why) is now a much easier-on-the-eye red
* New "double" image allocation technique to reduce crashes
* Expanded the 4096 character limit in the "notes" applet
* RAM units are automatically appended
* Changing themes will now change all system resources on the fly
* Finally fixed the CMOS RTC for real now
* HUGE optimizations (theoretically approx. 4 times faster animations)
* Fixed bug where the screen would be unaligned by 1 pixel
* Theme changing will now change the icons in the widgets view
* Icons (and thus by extention text / fonts) have been sped up by only calculating the alpha for the partially transparent pixels and normally drawing the opaque pixels and ignoring the translucent ones
* Fixed theme background colours being slightly off in the widgets view
* Fixed the example widgets background
* Fixed a few bugs to do with the layout compiler
